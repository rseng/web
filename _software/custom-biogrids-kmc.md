description: "KMC—K-mer Counter is a utility designed for counting k-mers (sequences of consecutive k symbols) in a set of reads from genome sequencing projects. K-mer counting is important for many bioinformatics applications, e.g., developing de Bruijn graph assemblers. Building de Bruijn graphs is a commonly used approach for genome assembly with data from second-generation sequencer. Unfortunately, sequencing errors (frequent in practice) results in huge memory …"
