description: "a suite of programs that allows users to carry out molecular dynamics simulations, particularly on biomolecules.  The suite can be used to carry out complete (non-periodic) molecular dynamics simulations (using NAB) with either explicit water or generalized Born solvent models.  The independently developed packages work well by themselves, and with Amber itself."
