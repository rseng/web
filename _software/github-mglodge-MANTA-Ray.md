description: "MANTA-Ray (Modified Absorption of Non-spherical Tiny Aggregates in the RAYleigh regime) is a model used to estimate the optical properties of fractal aggregates. It correctly predicts the amount of absorption that occurs for particles in the long-wavelength limit, to within an average error of 30%."
