description: "This is a modified version of the L-PICOLA code extending the COLA approach for simulating cosmological structure formation to theories that exhibit scale-dependent growth. It can compute matter power-spectra (CDM and total), redshift-space multipole power-spectra P0,P2,P4 and do halofinding on the fly. It can also include the effects of massive neutrinos on structure formation."
