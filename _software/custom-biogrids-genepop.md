description: "a population genetics package that computes exact tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, for population differentiation and for genotypic disequilibrium among pairs of loci; computes estimates of F-statistics, null allele frequencies, allele size-based statistics for microsatellites, etc.; and performs analyses of isolation by distance from pairwise comparisons of individuals or population samples, including confidence intervals for “neighborhood size”."
