description: "Wigglewave is a FORTRAN code that uses an RK4 finite difference method to solve the linearised governing equations for Torsional Alfv√©n Waves (TAWs) propagating in a plasma with negligible plasma beta and in a force-free axisymmetric magnetic field, with no azimuthal component, embedded in a high density divergent tube structure."
