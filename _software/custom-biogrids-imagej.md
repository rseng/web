description: "a Java image processing program inspired by NIH Image  that can display, edit, analyze, process, save and print 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit images. It can read many image formats including TIFF, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM, FITS and raw and supports stacks, a series of images that share a single window. It is multithreaded, so time-consuming operations can be performed in parallel with other operations."
