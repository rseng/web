description: "a Java program that finds potential disease-causing variants from whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data.  Starting from a VCF file and a set of phenotypes encoded using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), it will annotate, filter and prioritize likely causative variants based on user-defined criteria such as a variant's predicted pathogenicity, frequency of occurrence in a population and also how closely the given phenotype matches â€¦"
