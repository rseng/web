description: "(Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis) a tool for genome-wide complex trait analysis with five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation.  GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait â€¦"
