description: "(INFERence of RNA ALignment) searches DNA sequence databases for RNA structure and sequence similarities and uses a special case of profile stochastic context-free grammars called covariance models (CMs). In many cases It is more capable of identifying RNA homologs that conserve their secondary structure more than their primary sequence."
