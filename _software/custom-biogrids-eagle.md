description: "estimates haplotype phase either within a genotyped cohort or using a phased reference panel. Eagle2 is now the default phasing method used by the Sanger and Michigan imputation servers and uses a new, very fast HMM-based algorithm that improves speed and accuracy over existing methods via two key ideas: a new data structure based on the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform and a rapid search algorithm â€¦"
