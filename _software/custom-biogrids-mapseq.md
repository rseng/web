description: "a set of fast and accurate sequence read classification tools designed to assign taxonomy and OTU classifications to ribosomal RNA sequences. This is done by using a reference set of full-length ribosomal RNA sequences for which known taxonomies are known, and for which a set of high quality OTU clusters has been previously generated. For each read, the best guess and corresponding confidence in â€¦"
