description: "Developed for the detection of subtle allelic imbalance events from next-generation sequencing data, hapLOHseq is a sequencing-based extension of hapLOH, which is a method for the detection of subtle allelic imbalance events from SNP array data. It is capable of identifying events of 10 mega-bases or greater occurring in as little as 16% of the sample using exome sequencing data (at 80x) and 4% â€¦"
